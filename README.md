# Optimizing Data Workflows with Airflow and Spark

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a data pipeline built with Apache Airflow and Apache Spark to automate and optimize data workflows. It processes raw datasets, performs transformations, and generates actionable insights through interactive dashboards.

## Features
- **Automated Data Ingestion:** Fetch and store raw datasets for processing.
- **Data Transformation:** Process and aggregate data with Apache Spark.
- **Insights Generation:** Provide actionable insights through Spark transformations and analytics.
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Use Apache Airflow to schedule and manage tasks.

## Project Structure
- **ingest_data:** Reads raw data and saves it as a Parquet file.
- **process_data:** Transforms and aggregates the data for insights.
- **generate_insights:** Loads processed data and generates analytics outputs.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Apache Airflow:** Workflow orchestration and task scheduling.
- **Apache Spark:** Scalable and distributed data processing.
- **Python:** Core programming language for pipeline logic.
- **Parquet:** Storage format for optimized data storage and retrieval.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Apache Airflow installed and configured
- Apache Spark installed and configured

## Setup and Execution
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install apache-airflow pyspark
   ```

2. **Add the DAG file:**
   Save the `airflow_spark_pipeline.py` file to your Airflow DAGs directory.

3. **Start Airflow:**
   Initialize the database and start Airflow services:
   ```
   airflow db init
   airflow webserver --port 8080
   airflow scheduler
   ```

4. **Trigger the DAG:**
   Open the Airflow UI at `http://localhost:8080` and trigger the `spark_pipeline_dag`.

5. **Inspect Outputs:**
   Processed data is stored in `/tmp/processed_data/output.parquet`, and analytics are printed to the console.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time data sources (e.g., Kafka, IoT devices).
- Advanced data visualizations using Tableau or Power BI.
- Deployment in a cloud environment for scalability.
